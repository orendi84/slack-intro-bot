# Security Policy for Slack Intro Bot

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Slack Intro Bot project to protect against common security vulnerabilities and ensure safe operation.

## Security Features

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

- **XSS Protection**: All user input is sanitized to remove potentially dangerous HTML/JavaScript content
- **Injection Prevention**: Command injection and SQL injection patterns are blocked
- **Input Length Limits**: Maximum input lengths are enforced to prevent buffer overflow attacks
- **Pattern Validation**: User data is validated against safe patterns for names, usernames, and timestamps

### 2. File Security

- **Path Validation**: All file operations are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **File Extension Filtering**: Only allowed file extensions (`.md`, `.txt`, `.json`) are permitted
- **Secure Permissions**: Output files are created with restrictive permissions (600 - owner read/write only)
- **Filename Validation**: Filenames are validated to prevent injection of dangerous characters

### 3. Dependency Security

- **Pinned Versions**: Critical dependencies are pinned to specific versions to prevent supply chain attacks
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scans using `safety` and `bandit` tools
- **Security Updates**: Dependencies are regularly updated to address known vulnerabilities

### 4. Secrets Management

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No API keys, tokens, or passwords are hardcoded in the source code
- **Secure Configuration**: Configuration files are properly ignored by version control

### 5. Logging Security

- **Sensitive Data Redaction**: Log messages are automatically sanitized to remove sensitive information
- **Security Event Logging**: Security-related events are logged for monitoring
- **Structured Logging**: Logs follow a consistent format for easy analysis

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure security settings:

```bash
# Enable/disable security features
ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECKS=true
SANITIZE_INPUT=true
LOG_SECURITY_EVENTS=true

# Input validation limits
MAX_INPUT_LENGTH=10000
MAX_NAME_LENGTH=50

# File operation limits
MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH=255
```

### Security Manager

The `SecurityManager` class provides centralized security functionality:

```python
from security_config import get_security_manager

security = get_security_manager()

# Validate and sanitize input
sanitized_data = security.validate_and_sanitize_input(raw_data)

# Validate file operations
is_valid = security.validate_file_operation(filepath, "read")

# Create secure sessions
session_token = security.create_session()
```

## Security Scanning

### Automated Security Checks

Run the comprehensive security scan:

```bash
python security_scan.py
```

This script performs:
- Bandit static analysis
- Safety dependency scanning
- File permission checks
- Hardcoded secret detection
- Environment configuration validation
- Security configuration testing

### Pre-commit Hooks

Security checks are integrated into the development workflow via pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

The hooks include:
- Code formatting and linting
- Security scanning with Bandit
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- Secret detection
- File permission validation

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use `.env` files for sensitive configuration
2. **Validate all input**: Always use the security manager for input validation
3. **Use secure defaults**: Default to the most secure configuration
4. **Regular updates**: Keep dependencies updated
5. **Review code changes**: Always review security implications of changes

### For Deployment

1. **Environment isolation**: Use separate environments for development, staging, and production
2. **Access controls**: Implement proper file system permissions
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for security events
4. **Backup security**: Ensure backups are also secured
5. **Regular audits**: Perform regular security assessments

## Incident Response

### Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not create a public issue**: Security issues should be reported privately
2. **Contact maintainers**: Reach out to project maintainers directly
3. **Provide details**: Include steps to reproduce and potential impact
4. **Allow time**: Give maintainers time to assess and fix the issue

### Security Events

The application logs security events with the format:
```
SECURITY_EVENT: [EVENT_TYPE] user_id=[USER_ID] - [DETAILS]
```

Common event types:
- `INPUT_VALIDATION_FAILED`: Invalid input was rejected
- `FILE_OPERATION_BLOCKED`: Unauthorized file operation was prevented
- `SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY`: Unusual patterns detected

## Compliance

### Security Standards

This project follows security best practices from:
- OWASP Top 10
- Python Security Best Practices
- GitHub Security Best Practices

### Data Protection

- **Minimal data collection**: Only necessary data is collected and processed
- **Data sanitization**: All data is sanitized before storage or transmission
- **Access logging**: File access and modifications are logged
- **Secure deletion**: Sensitive data is properly removed when no longer needed

## Updates and Maintenance

### Regular Security Tasks

1. **Monthly**: Run security scans and update dependencies
2. **Quarterly**: Review and update security configuration
3. **Annually**: Perform comprehensive security audit

### Security Updates

Security updates are prioritized and released as soon as possible. Critical vulnerabilities are addressed within 24 hours.

## Contact

For security-related questions or to report vulnerabilities, please contact the project maintainers through private channels.
